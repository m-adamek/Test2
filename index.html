                <h2>Development Tools</h2>
                <p>Development tools are software programs that assist developers in creating, testing, and maintaining
                    software applications. These tools include integrated development environments (IDEs), version
                    control systems, and debugging tools that streamline the development process and improve code
                    quality. Popular examples of development tools are Visual Studio, Git, and Eclipse, which offer
                    features like code completion, version tracking, and error detection to enhance productivity and
                    collaboration among developers.</p>
